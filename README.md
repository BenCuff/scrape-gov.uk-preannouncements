This script needs tidying up and turning into a package for proper sharing, but essentially it can be used to scrape the information from the [gov.uk pre-announcements pages for official statistics](https://www.gov.uk/search/research-and-statistics?content_store_document_type=upcoming_statistics&organisations%5B%5D=uk-health-security-agency&order=updated-newest).

To make it work for other organisations, change the path in line 36 of the R script.
